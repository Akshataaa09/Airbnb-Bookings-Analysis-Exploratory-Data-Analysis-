# Airbnb-Bookings-Analysis-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-

This project involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Airbnb listing data. It focuses on understanding patterns and relationships between various features such as price, room type, availability, and reviews. The aim is to generate actionable insights for hosts, travelers, or platform designers.

## üìä Key Objectives

- Analyze distribution and trends in listing features (price, reviews, availability, etc.)
- Identify outliers and data skewness
- Understand the relationship between room types and listing characteristics
- Visualize data using pairplots and summary statistics

## üìÅ Files

- `alm_project_2.ipynb` ‚Äî Main Colab Notebook with code and visualizations
- `README.md` ‚Äî Project overview and instructions

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Open the notebook in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
2. Ensure necessary libraries (like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) are installed.
3. Run each cell to explore the analysis and insights.

## üîç Insights Summary

The EDA was conducted systematically, beginning with univariate analysis to explore the distribution and characteristics of individual features such as price, minimum nights, availability, and room types. Histograms, boxplots, and count plots were utilized to visualize these distributions effectively.

Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to study relationships between variables. Correlation matrices, scatter plots, and heatmaps were created to identify patterns between numerical features, while bar charts and violin plots helped analyze interactions between categorical and numerical variables. Special attention was given to understanding how neighborhood location, room type, and availability impacted the listing prices.

Missing values were carefully analyzed and treated based on the nature of the feature and the impact on the overall dataset. Outliers were detected and addressed where necessary, especially in critical fields such as price and minimum nights, to avoid skewed insights.

Key findings from the analysis highlighted that room type and neighborhood significantly influence listing prices. Entire homes and apartments commanded the highest prices, particularly in popular neighborhoods. Availability also emerged as a critical factor, with listings available year-round typically showing different pricing trends compared to short-term listings.

A minimum of fifteen different, logical, and meaningful visualizations were developed, offering clear insights at each stage. Each visualization was accompanied by a business interpretation, assessing its potential impact on pricing strategies, marketing efforts, and operational planning for Airbnb hosts.

The project follows best coding practices, including well-structured, modular, and commented code. All outputs are formatted cleanly, and the entire notebook is executable in a single run without errors, making it deployment-ready.
